## Key Challenges and Obstacles

Challenges include adapting governance systems to accommodate autonomous decision-making, ensuring legal and ethical accountability when AI systems operate independently, and overcoming trust issues in opaque AI processes (the "black box" problem). Security risks are critical as autonomous agents become targets for exploitation. Operational reliability is another concern, as AI-driven systems need robust error management and continuous learning to remain profitable and sustainable.

The complexity of collaboration across AI agents and integrating them with human oversight in hybrid models also requires sophisticated orchestration and real-time data integration.
