In this post, we'll dive deeper into some of the cool features offered by the Hextra theme.

## Responsive Design

Hextra is built with a responsive design, meaning your website will look great on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Dark Mode

One of my favorite features is the built-in dark mode. It's easy on the eyes and gives your site a modern feel.

## Customization

The theme is highly customizable, allowing you to change colors, fonts, and layouts to match your brand.
