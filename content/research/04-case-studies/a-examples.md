## Examples of autonomous AI businesses or AI DAOs

That's an excellent question that sits at the intersection of two rapidly evolving technologies.

While you won't find a traditional "business" with a CEO and HR department that is also a self-governing AI, there is a new and growing category of organizations that fit this description: AI DAOs.

These are entire networks and platforms dedicated to building and running AI services, where the governance (decision-making, funding, and rules) is managed entirely by their members, not by a central company.

Here are concrete examples of AI projects that are self-governing.

## Bittensor (TAO)

 Bittensor is a decentralized peer-to-peer network that acts as a global marketplace for machine learning models. Instead of one company (like OpenAI) owning a single large model, Bittensor allows thousands of models to compete and collaborate.
 
 How it's Self-Governing:

Consensus Mechanism: It uses a unique model called Proof of Intelligence (PoI). AI models on the network are constantly evaluated and ranked by other models.

Rewards: The best-performing models (those that provide the most value or "intelligence" to the network) are rewarded with the network's native token, $TAO.

Governance: The $TAO token is also a governance token. Holders of $TAO can vote on proposals to upgrade the network, change its rules, or direct its future. Governance is handled by a "Senate" (composed of the network's top validators) who vote on proposals submitted by the "Triumvirate" (the core foundation team), ensuring a balance between expert opinion and decentralized control.

## Fetch.ai (now part of the ASI Alliance)
 
 What it is: Fetch.ai is a platform for building and deploying "Autonomous Economic Agents." These are AI-powered software programs that can perform tasks on behalf of individuals or businesses, like booking travel, trading assets, or managing energy grids.
 
 How it's Self-Governing:

Recent Merger: Fetch.ai recently merged with SingularityNET and Ocean Protocol to form the Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance.

Governance Model: The governance for this new, larger AI network is consolidated under the $FET token (which will be renamed $ASI).

Token Voting: Any holder of the $FET token can participate in governance. They can submit proposals on topics like network upgrades, funding for new projects, or changes to operational parameters. The community then votes, and the weight of each member's vote is typically proportional to the number of tokens they hold.

## SingularityNET (AGIX)
 
 What it is: This is one of the oldest and most well-known AI DAOs. It's a decentralized marketplace where anyone can create, share, and monetize AI services. If you need an AI algorithm for image recognition, you can "hire" one from the marketplace.
 
 How it's Self-Governing:

AGIX Token: The platform is governed by holders of its $AGIX token.

Progressive Decentralization: The project's goal has always been "progressive decentralization," meaning it slowly transitions power from its founding foundation to the community of $AGIX token holders.

Community Voting: Token holders can vote on everything from technical upgrades to how the organization's treasury should be spent. A key part of its ecosystem is SingularityDAO, a separate but related project that even uses AI to automatically manage portfolios of digital assets, all of which is governed by its own community.

## How AI is Used Inside Governance

What makes these examples truly unique is that AI isn't just the product—it's also becoming part of the process of self-governance.

Automated Evaluation: In Bittensor, AI is the core of the governance and reward system. The AI models themselves are what decide "who did a good job" and "who gets paid."

Treasury Management: In SingularityDAO, AI is used to manage the organization's treasury and financial products, a key function that would normally be handled by a human finance team.

Proposal Analysis: Other DAOs are beginning to use AI to summarize complex technical proposals, analyze potential security risks in new code, or gauge community sentiment on a topic, making it easier for human members to cast informed votes.
