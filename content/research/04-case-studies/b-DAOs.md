## Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO)

> In short: DAOs are self-governing because their rules are enforced by code (smart contracts) rather than by people. Decisions are made collectively by members who vote with tokens, and the outcomes are executed automatically and transparently on the blockchain.

A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program (known as smart contracts) that is transparent, controlled by the organization's members, and not influenced by a central government or single entity.

Think of it as a community-owned and operated entity without a CEO or board of directors. All decisions are made from the bottom up by the community itself.

## How DAOs Govern Themselves
Self-governance is the core feature of a DAO. This process is managed directly on a blockchain through a combination of code and collective decision-making.
Here’s the typical step-by-step process:

### The Rules are Coded in Smart Contracts
First, the foundational rules of the DAO are written into smart contracts. These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. 

What they do: These smart contracts define the DAO's purpose, its rules, and how it functions. This can include everything from how voting works, how to manage the group's treasury, or what is required to pass a proposal.

Why it matters: Because these rules are on a blockchain, they are transparent (everyone can see them) and immutable (they can't be changed by a single person without the group's consent). This eliminates the need for a central authority to enforce rules.

### Membership & Voting Rights (Governance Tokens)

To participate in governance, members usually need to hold the DAO's specific governance token.

How it works: Holding this token is like holding shares in a company or having a membership card. It grants you the right to vote on proposals.
 
 Voting Power: In many DAOs, the number of tokens you hold determines the weight of your vote (e.g., 10 tokens = 10 votes). However, some DAOs are exploring other models, like "one person, one vote" or systems based on reputation.

### The Proposal and Voting Process
 
This is how decisions are actually made:

Proposal: Any member (usually by holding a certain number of tokens) can submit a proposal for the community to vote on. This could be a proposal to fund a new project, change a rule, or move money from the DAO's treasury.

Debate: The community discusses the proposal, often on platforms like Discord or dedicated forums.

Vote: A formal on-chain vote is held. Members use their governance tokens to cast their votes ("yes," "no," or "abstain").

Execution: If the proposal receives the required number of "yes" votes to pass (a pre-defined "quorum"), the smart contract automatically executes the decision. For example, if the vote was to send 100 ETH to a developer, the smart contract will automatically transfer those funds from the DAO's treasury as soon as the vote passes.
